**Spotify Playlist API Testing Project
**
This project showcases my API testing work for the Spotify Playlist API. I tested various playlist operations such as creating playlists, updating playlist details, adding tracks, removing tracks, and retrieving playlist information. All testing was performed in Postman using collection variables. I organised all requests inside a single collection and used Postman tests to validate status codes, responses, error handling, and JSON Schema validation. Additionally, I prepared a detailed test plan covering the scope, objectives, test approach, risks, and entry–exit criteria for the project. Also, I created a comprehensive Excel sheet that contains all manual test cases, including positive and negative scenarios, functional checks, and validation rules. This project reflects my practical understanding of API testing, request–response validation, authorisation handling using access tokens, and building a structured testing workflow in Postman.
